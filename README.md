#### âš¡ Additional Interests

ðŸ–¥ Gaming

I am a huge fan of [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/). I also enjoy Minecraft, EFT, and Satisfactory.

ðŸš€ Investing

Investing is a more recent interest I've taken up only in the past few years have I been able to try it out and I think I'm getting better at it. One thing I've learned is to go with [Webull](https://act.webull.com/v/hRHppUAgijjI/0am/) over [Robinhood](http://join.robinhood.com/stephes769) for it's extended hours trading(4am-7pm@free vs 9am-6pm@$5/mo).
